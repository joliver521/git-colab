# GIT Collaboration

Somebody screenshare, others navigate, create a GIT repo and push an initial commit to this new repo. 

Everyone should clone the repo locally, then create an appropriately-named branch to make a little change.

One person should update the CSS to make the H1 display with red text

One person should update the Javascript to make the alert say "JS is updated"

one person should update the HTML, make the H1 tag say "Updated HTML Content"

one person should update the HTML, adding "centered-text" class to teh H1 to center it.

Everyone will commit and then push their branch to origin, and then create a pull request. Someone else should review and approve. And then the person who made the change should merge the pull request.
